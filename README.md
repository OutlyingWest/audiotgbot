This is a Telegram bot for audio files conversion.

This bot was created for personal use.
Sometimes I like to play guitar and often record the result
in the form of voice messages to work on mistakes
and save interesting ideas.
This bot is designed to help save my voice messages in more
convenient formats and also store them in a single database.

Basic functionality:
- Authomatically ability to converse voice message to .mp3 and send .mp3 file back to a bot user 
- Conversions from .ogg to .mp3
- Other format of conversions or functionality may be added later...
